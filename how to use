* This script as mentioned used to ease the management of SRX with multiple Logical systems. 
* Input: you can use a csv file with source IPs in a column and the destination IPs in the next column if you are using subnetting
you can use the first IP of each subnet. 

* Output: currently the output is a csv with source / destination zones, interfaces, IPs.
* It collects other data : routing instances, logical systems that can be used for further development. 


Thank you,
